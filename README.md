# CS193p-F17-Project3
Project 3 of Stanfords CS193p Developing iOS 11 Apps with Swift course.

A game inspired by the popular "Set" card game, now using the familiar visuals.

NOTE: This project was simply a step in learning Swift, therefore the actual
game implemented is only looseley inspired by the Set Card game and does not
actually play like the actual game.
